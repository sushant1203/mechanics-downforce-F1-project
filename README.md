# Understanding Downforce in Formula 1

## üìú Project Overview

This repository documents a **high school research project** that investigated the fundamental principles of aerodynamic **downforce in Formula 1 (F1) racing**. Developed as a collaborative pair project, our research and findings were consolidated into a comprehensive poster presentation and a detailed project diary, both of which are linked below.

This README provides a summary of the core concepts explored, methodologies used, and key learnings from this in-depth study.

## üèÅ Core Concepts Explored & Analyzed

Our research, as detailed in the poster, focused on the following key areas:

### What is Downforce?
Downforce (negative lift) is a critical aerodynamic force in F1, essential for maintaining car stability and enabling high-speed cornering by maximising aerodynamic grip.

### Key Physics Principles Applied
* **Newton‚Äôs 3rd Law:** Explains the fundamental generation of downforce through air interaction. The car's aerodynamic design (splitters, canards, wings) is optimised to leverage this.
* **Aircraft Wings vs. F1 Car Wings:** We analysed how F1 wings adapt aerodynamic principles, effectively inverting aircraft wing design to generate downward rather than upward force.
* **Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle:** Applied to understand the pressure differentials across wing surfaces that result in downforce.
* **Newton‚Äôs 2nd Law (Impact of Car Weight):** Investigated the relationship, showing how increased mass (potentially increasing gravitational downforce component) adversely affects acceleration.

### Impact of Car Weight on Performance & Downforce
A critical aspect of F1 car design involves balancing the benefits of increased downforce (potentially from added weight) against performance penalties:
* **Advantages:** Improved balance, handling, and high-speed cornering stability.
* **Disadvantages:** Reduced acceleration/top speed, increased fuel consumption, greater tire wear, and decreased agility.
* **Conclusion:** The optimal setup requires a strategic balance contingent on track characteristics, weather, and specific car/driver attributes.

## üí° Interesting Facts & Further Research Points

Our research also compiled several interesting facts and areas for further aerodynamic consideration:

* **Magnitude of Downforce:** F1 cars can generate aerodynamic downforce up to 5g (five times their weight) at speed.
* **Historical Examples:** The Red Bull RB6 is renowned for its exceptional downforce generation.
* **Theoretical Capabilities:** The potential for F1 cars to drive upside down due to downforce.
* **Further Concepts:** Angle of attack, drag implications, the role of vortex generators, and maintaining aerodynamic balance across the car.
